  Ok so there are few things I'd like to get straight

  1. we read the header
  2. we mix the options from the header with those passed in from the command
  3. template the file
  3. we create a page with those options

  0. [x] create a command for each file in the _boilerplate folder
  1. [x] the user runs the new page command.
  2. [] Open the boiler plate file associated with command
  3. [] Extract out the header options from the boilerplate file
  4. [] Extract out the template from the boilerplate file without the header.
  5. [] Mix the default options with then header options then the flag options.
  6. [] check for missing options. like path.
  7. [] Template the boilerplate with the options
  8. [] write the new file

  Extact out the template from the boilerplate file


  0. user runs command, 
  1. open the boilerplate file
  2. read out the options
